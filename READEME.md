practice-c-classes
==================

This code was written specifically to practice for a summer test in order to get into CSCI2312 at University of Colorado Denver in the Fall 2017 Semester.

It's not an ideal project to professional software development skills.

I'm practicing for the following: "The problem is to set up a couple of classes, one that points to the other with a pointer, then you search and sort through that data using vectors."
